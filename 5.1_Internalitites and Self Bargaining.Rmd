Another way of thinking about this problem is within the framework of *internalities*. Whitman (2006) explains how internalities give place to *self-bargaining* and a consistent result. 
If we split an individual into two selfs, we can define the present-self and the future-self. The present-self wants to smoke because she perceives the pleasure of smoking, while the future-self does not want the individual-self to smoke, since it has negative consequences for her health. This is based on the idea that externalities are reciprocal: if the present-self smokes, it has a negative effect on the future-self, but if the present-self does not smoke, it has a negative effect on herself. These externalities between different selfs in the time of a single individual are called internalities. Can this internality be solved? 

A bargaining between the present-self and a representation of the future-self in the present is necessary. If the contract is very strict and rigid (smoking is not allowed), it is very likely that the present-self does not respect the contract and all benefits will be lost. If, on the other hand, the contract allows exceptions (such as smoking less quantity or having certain foods allowed on some occasions), it is more likely that the present-self respect the contract.

Note that a plan like this is consistent in time. The individual has a contract with her future-self, which specifies the special situations when she is able to eat something not allowed in the regular diet or smoke a cigar.
