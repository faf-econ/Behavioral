It has been shown that time inconsistency and decreasing discount rate are anomalies in the exponential function. Therefore, hyperbolic and quasi-hyperbolic functions were introduced and explained to deal with these problems. The question arising now is: What are the implications of these anomalies? What does it mean that people cannot stick to a plan? How they deal with these problems when they have to make decisions? 

In this section, I will focus on one of the most important consequences of the temporal inconsistency: the lack of self-control to make decisions. The fact that people have a lower rate of impatience in the present than in the future, that is to say, that they suffer of present bias, means that they cannot stick to their plans.
Two of the most used examples to reflect the problem of self-control are those of the smoker and the individual who wants start a diet-regime. Both the smoker and the overweight person suffer from lack of self control when they decide to stop smoking / eat healthy in the future but can never achieve it. In the previous sections I explained the presence of present bias from a formal perspective. Now, I will explain how this affect decision making from the conceptual perspective, using the examples of the smoker and the overweight person. 

For the future, they vow to quit smoke and unhealthy food in exchange for long term rewards (better health) because they use a smaller discount rate for rewards in the future. However, as times go by, the pleasure of smoking a cigarette or eating cake are very high. Therefore, the smoker and the overweight individual decide to smoke a cigarette and eat a cake today, but plan to stop doing so next month. When the next month arrives, the present bias comes back into action, because the option of smoking and eating unhealthy are again very desirable, since the pleasure of doing so now is very high. This problem of self-control produces that the individuals cannot respect their plans and leave unhealthy habits becomes very difficult.

Several authors from Behavioral Economics proposed different mechanism to fix the problem of self control. Different kinds of *Paternalism* were discussed in the last decades. Explain how Paternalism deal with present bias and lack of self control is not part of this paper. However, it is interesting to know that there are other ``self-mechanisms" (often used against Paternalism proposals) to deal with these problems. In the following paragraphs I will briefly describe *internalities and self-bargaining* and *sophistication*.
